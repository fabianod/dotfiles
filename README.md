A collection of all of my dot files (.vimrc, .bashrc, etc.) and scripts

Also has some pretty nifty Python files

I mainly use the scripts/files that text information to myself as they are the quickest, easiest, and most light-weight measure to send myself random information.

##### [CredentialManager](https://github.com/dsouzarc/dotfiles/blob/master/Python/CredentialManager.py)
Quickly and easily manage credentials like API tokens


##### [TextPDF](https://github.com/dsouzarc/dotfiles/blob/master/Python/TextPDF.py)
Given a link, calls an API to get a PDF view of the link, and texts/emails that PDF to myself.
Great for saving something to read later and for avoiding pay-walls (i.e.: 10 free articles a month)


##### [TextScreenshot](https://github.com/dsouzarc/dotfiles/blob/master/Python/TextScreenshot.py)
Similar to TextPDF, but mainly for taking a screenshot of something and sending it to myself


##### [TextPhone](https://github.com/dsouzarc/dotfiles/blob/master/Python/TextPhone.py)
Send myself a text from the commandline 


##### [TextLink](https://github.com/dsouzarc/dotfiles/blob/master/Python/TextLink.py)
Send myself a link from the commandline. Shortens a link if it is too long


##### [iOS App Icon Resizer](https://github.com/dsouzarc/dotfiles/blob/master/Python/iOSAppIconResizer.py)
Resize an icon to the appropriate iOS app icon sizes
